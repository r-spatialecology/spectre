# spectre ![](reference/figures/spectre.png)

The goal of `spectre` is to provide an open source tool capable of
predicting regional community composition at fine spatial resolutions
using only sparse biological and environmental data.

## Installation

Install the release version from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("spectre")
```

To install the developmental version of `spectre`, use:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("r-spatialecology/spectre")
```

A full use case example is included in the “Getting started with
spectre” vignette associated with the package.
