// LINUX ONLY:
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN  // This tells Catch to provide a main() - only do this in one cpp file
#include "catch.h"

//Exactly one source file must #define either CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN or CATCH_CONFIG_RUNNER before
//#include-ing Catch.
//In this file do not write any test cases!
//In most cases that means this file will just contain two lines (the #define and the #include).
