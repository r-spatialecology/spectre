  abstract = "For many taxonomic groups, sparse information on the spatial
              distribution of biodiversity limits our capacity to answer a
              variety of theoretical and applied ecological questions.
              Modelling community-level attributes ($\alpha$- and
              $\beta$-diversity) over space can help overcome this shortfall in
              our knowledge, yet individually, predictions of $\alpha$- or
              $\beta$-diversity have their limitations. In this study, we
              present a novel approach to combining models of $\alpha$- and
              $\beta$-diversity, with sparse survey data, to predict the
              community composition for all sites in a region. We applied our
              new approach to predict land snail community composition across
              New Zealand. As we demonstrate, these predictions of
              metacommunity composition have diverse potential applications,
              including predicting $\gamma$-diversity for any set of sites,
              identifying target areas for conservation reserves, locating
              priority areas for future ecological surveys, generating
              realistic compositional data for metacommunity models and
              simultaneously predicting the distribution of all species in a
              taxon consistent with known community diversity patterns.",
