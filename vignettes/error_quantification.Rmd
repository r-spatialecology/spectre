Depending on the available input data, we evaluated the spectre algorithm using different measures. 

## Discrepancy between target and solution
Given a known target $T$, derived for example from an empirical data set, we quantified the discrepancy $D$ between a target $T$ and a solution $S$ as:
$$D = { \frac{(\lvert T - S \rvert )} {\sum_{n=1}^{1000}(\lvert T - S_{rand} \rvert) / 1000}) }, $$

where $S_{rand}$ is derived from a landscape constrained to match the species richness of all sites, but species are assigned randomly to each site. Since the absolute value of $(\lvert T - S \rvert )$ is determined not only by the correctness of the solution, but depends also on landscape size and species composition (see Appendix), standardizing by the average absolute discrepancy of 1000 random initial solutions makes $D$ a convenient measure to quantify and compare errors across landscapes of different size and species compositions. For a perfect solution, discrepancy $D$ is 0, and for a randomly assigned initial solution, given the constraints explained above, $D$ is approximately 1. We evaluated the performance of the spectre algorithm as the discrepancy $D_{com}$ between the commonness matrices of the target $T_{com}$ and the solution $S_{com}$. 

## Proportion of correctly predicted site x site commonness
This measure is NOT identical to the "proportion of occurrences correctly predicted", as used by Makony et al. (2011), please see below (I misunderstood Makony's measure in the beginning). 

Our measure, the proportion of correctly predicted site x site commonness, $P_{correct}$, is obtained from the difference between $T_{com}$ and $S_{com}$ as follows: 
$$P_{correct} = { \frac{C_{correct}}{m}  }$$,
where $C_{correct}$ is the number of cases/sites where $T_{com} - S_{com} == 0$, and m is the number of site x site pairs for a given landscape. The condition $T_{com} - S_{com} == 0$ is quite strict, and thus a conservative measure. Mokany et al. report, that with 6.7 million sites, their absolute mean error in pair-wise $\beta$-dissimilarity translates to $T_{com} - S_{com} < 3$. That means, with an average richness of 38 per site, given 19 species in common between two sites, their solution would have between 16 and 22 species in common. But again, they solve blocks of 2500 sites, and 6.7 million sites in total. 

## Proportion of occurrences correctly predicted 
This measure is on the level of species lists, and thus requires species labelling. Without either a kind of weighing of species occurrence probabilities at initialization, or without inclusion of species lists from a few sites as "known data", probabilities to obtain meaningful scores are low. This measure was taken from Makony et al. (2011). The proportion of occurrences correctly predicted $O_{correct}$ is the per site proportion of the correctly predicted species $S_{correct}$ divided by per site richness $R$, averaged across all sites:

$$ O_{correct} = \sum_{site = 1}^{site = n} { \frac{S_{correct}} { {R \cdot n}} }$$.  

# Testing the spectre algorithm with artificial and empirical data

We tested the spectre algorithm both with empirical, as well with artificial data. 

## Using the BCI data set to evaluate performance: 
The Barro Colorado Island (BCI) study area is divided into a 20x20 m grid. All trees within the grids are sampled regularly since 1985 (Condit et al. 2019). Using the last recent "tree.table8", we considered each grid cell in the data as one site, and generated a presence/absence list for all observed 328 tree species from 1251 sites. Mean tree richness per site was 74.6 (SD = 10.8) (see additional description of the data in Appendix). 

For testing, we subsampled a desired number of randomly selected sites and species from the complete BCI presence/absence list. By chance not all sampled species were present within the sampled size, thus realized gamma diversity in our samples could be smaller than the desired number of species. If not stated otherwise, we used realized gamma diversity for our evaluations (see Chapter "Influence of gamma diversity" on spectre performance TODO).   
### Testing weighting feature with BCI data (WIP)

Since cells in BCI data have numbers for rows and columns, we could also sample blocks of adjacent cells and (1) investigate how much species compositions are correllated within blocks, and (2) test our weighting procedere with these blocks.  

### BCI results
The spectre algorithm was able to solve small- to medium-sized sized landscapes ( < 100 sites, < 150 species) with a discrepancy in commonness $D_{com}$ < 0.15 and a proportion of > 0.6 correctly solved siteXsite pairs ($P_{correct}$). We thus believe that spectre is a valuable tool to generate (artificial) species compositions that match the constrains of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity predictions. I admit that the plots are kind of ugly, and would like to switch to a presentation of "minimal Discrepancy" per replicate later, but I think for now they are good enough TODO. 

```{r refBCI60k, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fig. X Left: Discrepancy $D$ between target, and solutions generated by the spectre algorithm, for different landscape sizes and species numbers. Right: Proportion of correctly solved siteXsite pair commonness $P_{cor}$", out.width = '50%', fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("BCI60kDisc.png","BCI60kPcor.png") )
```

Additionally, I tested how well spectre could handle larger landscapes with more species. 

```{r refBCI60kBig, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fig. X Left: Discrepancy $D$ between target, and solutions generated by the spectre algorithm, for different landscape sizes and species numbers. Right: Proportion of correctly solved siteXsite pair commonness $P_{cor}$", out.width = '50%', fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("BCI60kDiscBig.png","BCI60kPcorBig.png") )
```

## Adding known species
Including species lists from a number of known sites improved (1) discrepancy $D_{com}$, $P_{correct}$ and $O_{correct}$. Fixing species compositions of > 30 sites furthermore reduced the chances that the algorithm was stuck in a local minimum, und thus $D_{com}$ was largely improved. Here we used subsamples with 100 sites and 100 species.

With some caution, given 100 sites and 100 species, I would suggest that (1) extrapolation from 40 known sites to 100 sites in total would be a feasible task for spectre.

```{r refBCI60kKnownSites1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fig. X Left: Discrepancy $D$ between target, and solutions generated by the spectre algorithm, with a proportion of fixed species compositions. Right: Proportion of correctly solved siteXsite pair commonness $P_{cor}$", out.width = '50%', fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("BCI60kDiscKnownSites.png", "BCI60kPcorKnownSites.png") )
```

```{r refBCI60kKnownSites2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fig. X Proportion of correctly predicted species. ", out.width = '50%', fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("BCI60kSpeciesKnownSites.png") )
```

\newpage
## Using the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to evaluate performance:
"The data consists of binary presence/absence matrices for 569 bird species across 49 US states for two time slices (1980 - 1985 and 2000 - 2005). Only species (identified by AOU number) recorded during both time periods are included. The data are taken from the North American Breeding Bird Survey dataset and from a version of the database downloaded in May 2009." paragraph stolen from the betapart-package!!! 

For testing, we subsampled a desired number of randomly selected sites and species from the complete bbs presence/absence list. By chance not all sampled species were present within the sampled size, thus realized gamma diversity in our samples could be smaller than the desired number of species. If not stated otherwise, we used realized gamma diversity for our evaluations (see Chapter "Influence of gamma diversity" on spectre performance TODO).  

```{r refBBSRealized, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Number of sampled species vs. realized gamma diversity. ", out.width = '50%', fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("BBS60kRealizedSpec.png") )
```

### BBS results 

The spectre algorithm was able to solve small- to medium-sized sized landscapes ( < 50 sites, < 200 species) with a discrepancy in commonness $D_{com}$ < 0.05 and a proportion of > 0.75 correctly solved siteXsite pairs ($P_{correct}$). We thus believe that spectre is a valuable tool to generate (artificial) species compositions that match the constrains of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity predictions. I admit that the plots are kind of ugly, and would like to switch to a presentation of "minimal Discrepancy" per replicate later, but I think for now they are good enough TODO.

```

## Using artificial data to evaluate performance:
For testing, in the simplest case, we generated speciesXsite list and filled them with the desired number of random species. The resulting lists, while being biologically unrealistic, allowed us to perform evaluations for a range of situations (average richness high-low, ... )
