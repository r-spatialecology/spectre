\usage{
generate_data_virtualspecies(
  landscape_size,
  correlation,
  community_size,
  gamma,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape_size}{size (sidelength) of the landscape}

\item{correlation}{strength of spatial autocorrelation within each species}

\item{community_size}{size of species communities, defined as proportion of gamma (defines strength of spatial autocorrelation between species: large communities = strong correlation)}

\item{gamma}{Total (estimated) species in the landscape}

\item{beta}{Species suitability treshhold}
}
\value{
rasterstack

\description{
Create multiple rasters of virtual species distribution based on suitability maps
}
\details{
The function generates virtual species distributions, using the virtualspecies package.
These species are distributed according to suitability maps that are created with the NLMR package first.
In order to provide both, control over spatial autocorrelation within and between species the following approach is applied:
\enumerate{
\item Correlation among species:
We assume, that a community has a certain habitat suitability. Each community however, may consist of multiple species.
Thus, when creating sitability maps, we do not neccessarily create one for each species, but one for each community.
Thus, if community_size = 0, each species will build its own community, resulting in low correlation among species.
If community_size = 1, the same suitability map will be used for each species, resulting in very high correlation among species.
\item Correlation within species:
We also want to investigate the effect of spatial clustering within each species.
Thus, we use the gaussian field landscape of NLMR. We can use the correlation parameter to define the strength of spatial autocorrelation.
When correlation = 0, the landscape suitability is distributed more or less random, wheres spatial clustering is present for higher values.
}

The function will finally report a rasterstack with species distribution (presence/absence) of each species.

\examples{

landscape_size <- 50
gamma <- 100
correlation <- 0 # low values = little spatial autocorrelation
community_size <- 0.1 # 10\% of gamma -> 10 communities
beta <- 0.75  # lower beta = wider species distributions

## Generate species:
spp <- generate_data_virtualspecies(landscape_size, correlation, community_size, gamma, beta)
## Investigate distributions:
raster::plot(spp)
## Calculate species richness:
alpha <- sum(spp)
