\usage{
run_optimization_min_conf(
  alpha_list,

  target,
  max_iterations,
  partial_solution = NULL,
  fixed_species = NULL,
  seed = NA,
  verbose = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{alpha_list}{\code{Matrix} of predicted alpha diversity (species richness) in
each cell.}

\item{total_gamma}{Total number of species present throughout the entire
landscape.}

\item{target}{Pairwise matrix of species in common between each site by site
pair.}

\item{max_iterations}{The maximum number of iterations that the optimization
algorithm may run through before stopping.}

\item{partial_solution}{An initial \code{matrix} of species presences and
absences for each site in the landscape. The total number of presences must
match the estimated species richness of each site.}

\item{fixed_species}{Fixed partial solution with species that are considered
as given. Those species are not going to be changed during optimization.}

\item{seed}{Seed for random number generator. Seed must be a positive integer value.
\code{seed = NA} means that a random integer is used as seed.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE} (default), a progress report is printed during
the optimization run.}

\item{interruptible}{Allow to interrupt...dough!}
}
\value{
A species presence/absence \code{matrix} of the study landscape.
}
\description{
Generate an optimized estimate of community composition
(species presences and absences) for every site in the study area.

\details{
\code{run_optimization_min_conf} is the core function of the
\code{spectre} package. The underlying algorithm of this function is
adapted from Mokany et al. (2011). A pairwise commonness matrix (having the
same structure as the \code{target} matrix) is calculated from the
\code{partial_solution} matrix and the value difference with the
\code{target} determined. If a difference is present and depending on the
set stopping criteria the algorithm continues. A random site in the
presence/absence matrix is selected, and a random presence record at this
site replaced with an absence. Every absence in the selected site is then
individually flipped to a presence and the value difference with the
objective recorded. The presence record which resulted in the lowest value
difference (minimum conflict) is retained. This cycle continues, with a
random site selected every iteration, until the pairwise commonness and
objective matrices match or the algorithm runs beyond the
\code{max_iterations}.
