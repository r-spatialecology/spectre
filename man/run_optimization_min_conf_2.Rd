\arguments{
\item{alpha_list}{Matrix of predicted alpha diversity in each cell.}

\item{total_gamma}{Total (estimated) species in the system.}

\item{target}{Pairwise matrix of species in common.}

\item{fixed_species}{Partial solution with species that are considered as given.}

\item{max_runs}{Max number of loops before stopping.}

\item{energy_threshold}{Optimization stops if energy threshold is reached. This is set as a value between 0 and 1 determining the proportion of error accepted}

\item{seed}{Seed for random number generator. seed = 0 means that a time stamp is used as seed.}

\item{verbose}{It TRUE, progress report is printed}
